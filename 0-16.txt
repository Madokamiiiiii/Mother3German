First, know this.[BREAK]
These are specially-protected islands.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
We reside upon these islands together with[BREAK]
a limitless power.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
That power is the Dragon that sleeps in the[BREAK]
darkness under the islands.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
The Dragon is incredibly large. About as[BREAK]
large as all these islands put together.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Because the Dragon is asleep, these islands[BREAK]
are protected from disaster.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
But its power is too great for humans to[BREAK]
control.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
It was for this reason that our ancient[BREAK]
Magypsy ancestors placed seven "Needles"[BREAK]
in the Dragon to make it sleep.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
One Needle for each Magypsy.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
For a very, very long time, we have[BREAK]
continued to guard the Needles.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
But it has been told that someone to wake[BREAK]
the Dragon will appear when its power is[BREAK]
needed...[BREAK]
[BREAK]
However, if the one who needs the Dragon's[BREAK]
power has a heart of evil, that power will[BREAK]
obey all that is evil. It's very possible that[BREAK]
everything could be completely destroyed[BREAK]
simply to satisfy wicked ambition.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
On the other hand, the exact opposite is[BREAK]
what we hope for. If a person with a heart[BREAK]
of good pulls the Dragon's Needles and uses[BREAK]
its power, the fate of all evil will be washed[BREAK]
away, and all life as we know it will shine[BREAK]
brightly.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
That is what is told.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Finally, listen to this, but don't worry.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
When each of our seven Needles is pulled,[BREAK]
we Magypsies will cease to be, our[BREAK]
millennia-long lives over.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Isn't that just romantic of us?[HEART][BREAK]
