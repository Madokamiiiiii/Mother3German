Mother 3/Earthbound 2 Save State Frog Library
by Zip Code Ness

INTRODUCTION
I played the game a second time to both enjoy the game and as well do something really nice for people who do work with Mother 3. So I made a save state library, and it was as if I hit two birds with one stone. The second playthrough was just as good as the first playthrough.

INSTRUCTIONS
This save state library was made using Virtual Boy. It might not work with any other emulator, but it may. Take the desired save state and COPY it to the directory in which the Mother 3 ROM is in. Then rename the save state to the name of the ROM. Open up the ROM in the emulator and when one loads the OPEN option on the main screen there will be two options: the TOP and the BOTTOM. Each has the chapter and time marked as well as the pictures of the players and of course the level of the leader. These save states were of course done by the frog. Every save state is written here in this text file, and one can browse through the list to see where he or she would like to start playing.

Please DO NOT rename the original save states or use the original save state library to play the game with. This is because everytime one saves using a frog, the save state will change accordingly. Rather it is suggested to keep all the save states in one folder and the ROM in another folder, and have the player copy the desired save state to the folder with the ROM in it.

QUALITY of SAVE STATES
I tried to make sure that most of the save states had completely healthy characters, the items organized in their bags, and the best weaponry. Though there will be some parts of the save states where it couldn't be done, or I simply forgot to organize the files. I'm sorry for the the inconvinence in those certain cases.

I made sure all the names were based on default, except for the player and Kumatora. Kumatora's name is too long for the game to handle, and thus I nicknamed her "Kumi". Instead of putting my name in the player, I decided to put the word "Hashem" in. "Hashem" in Hebrew means "the name" but it also means "G-d". Thus it gives a double meaning.

INTERESTING NOTES

In CH 5 I decided to go back and battle the maestro ghoul before continuing on to look for the Hummingbirds egg. This gives Duster a special pair of boots that work magic all the way up to the eigth chapter.

Since the times are written down, we can now distinguish the longer chapters from the shorter chapters.

PRO/CH. 1 - 1 hour and 44 mins
CHAPTER 2 - 1 hour and 58 mins
CHAPTER 3 - 1 hour and 33 mins
CHAPTER 4 - 2 hours and 6 mins
CHAPTER 5 - 2 hours and 40 mins
CHAPTER 6 - 5 mins
CHAPTER 7 - 6 hours and 25 mins
CHAPTER 8 - 3 hours and 18 mins

MISC
If you haven't played the game first, go and play it once and then use the save state library.
