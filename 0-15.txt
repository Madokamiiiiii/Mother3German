[BREAK]
No one is simply born "strong".[BREAK]
[BREAK]
People only grow stronger little by little, by[BREAK]
encountering difficult situations and learning[BREAK]
not to run from them, no matter how[BREAK]
frightening or daunting they may be.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
[LUCAS 23 02 00]. That is exactly what you[BREAK]
have done to grow strong.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
However, you did not do it for yourself.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
You grew strong for those you would[BREAK]
otherwise be unable to help. They are the[BREAK]
reason you are strong.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Even now, you occasionally show a glimpse[BREAK]
of it, [LUCAS 23 02 00]. Fleeting images of that[BREAK]
once-pampered, crybaby boy can sometimes[BREAK]
be seen in your smile.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
You've come a very long way.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
There's no telling what to expect from here[BREAK]
on out, but if one thing is certain, it's that[BREAK]
those who believe in you will be right there[BREAK]
to help.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Trust in them.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Now go forth, toward whatever stands out[BREAK]
the most in your eyes.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Go, facing not the darkness, but the light.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
[LUCAS 23 02 00]...[BREAK]
And his companions...[BREAK]
[BREAK]
You have driven the enemy into a corner.[BREAK]
The enemy's back is to the wall.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
There is nothing to fear now.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Everyone is watching on, with complete[BREAK]
faith in you. In their hearts, they all say,[BREAK]
"Thank you!"[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Can you hear them?[BREAK][BREAK][BREAK][BREAK]
