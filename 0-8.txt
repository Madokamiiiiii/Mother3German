[BREAK]
It is possible that until now, the people of[BREAK]Tazmily Village had never known sadness.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
On sunny days and on cloudy days, they[BREAK]always greeted each other with smiles.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
They lived in harmony with the creatures of[BREAK]the forest.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
The strong would help the weak, and those[BREAK]who had would share with those who had[BREAK]not.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
However, it now appears the villagers have[BREAK]learned all too much about sadness.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Suddenly, everything is changing for the[BREAK]worse...[BREAK]
[BREAK]
When did this change begin?[BREAK]
Where did it begin?[BREAK]
What set it in motion, and why?[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Almost as if toys, the peaceful animals are[BREAK]being transformed into strange, ferocious[BREAK]creatures that attack people.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Some people, like [FLINT 23 01 00], have even[BREAK]had their families torn apart.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
Just what is this suspicious group that[BREAK]wears pig masks?[BREAK]
[BREAK]
What are these eerie objects that soar[BREAK]through the once-beautiful skies?[BREAK]
[BREAK]
And where could the missing [CLAUS 22 05 00][BREAK]be...?[BREAK]
[BREAK]
The mysteries continue to pile up.[BREAK]
[BREAK]
And so the tale first begins...[BREAK]
[BREAK]
...as a tragedy.[BREAK]
[BREAK][END]
